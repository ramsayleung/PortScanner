* Description
  this is a simple port scanner written by python with multiprocess
** Project Structure
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
 ├── argparse_parent_base.py //the parent parser to parse command-line argument 
 ├── host_file //example host file which you can save the host you wanna scan
 ├── misc.py //a little bit useful function
 ├── printer.py //handle the result,save to file,or print to console
 ├── syn_scan.py //a multiprocess scanner use syn scan (half-open)
 └── tcp_scan.py //a multiprocess scanner use tcp scan

** Tcp scan
   tcp scan is try to connect to the host with socket,if it makes it,the port is 
   open,vice versa.It is simple
** Syn scan
   The scanner sends the first handshake in the three-way handshake using the SYN
   flag and port to connect to the host in a TCP packet.If the host response with
   SYN-ACK,the port is open,or the host response with RST,the port is closed on the 
   server
** Usage
   First you should install [[https://github.com/phaethon/scapy][scapy]] with python3
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     python3 tcp_scan.py your_target_ip [optional argument]
   #+END_SRC 
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     python3 syn_scan.py your_target_ip [optional argument]
   #+END_SRC
   
   for more information,you can 
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     python3 syn_scan.py -h
   #+END_SRC
   you will get:
